Tracker system I created to allow me to update with achievements and tag with goals

## Set up

add a `temp` folder in the root

`yarn` to get the dependencies

### How to customise

At the moment this is using vscode snippets to allow me to tag achievements with different goals so you can make updates in the `.vscode/useful-code-snippets` file

### How to use

`yarn updateFiles` will scan through all the files and collate the various info that you have tagged

`yarn build` will update the files but also push to github

The files will appear in the `progress-main.md` file all linked up and the weekly reports will appear in a list in their appropriate month
